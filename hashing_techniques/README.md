# Comparing the three hasing techniques
The animated GIF shows how the pool of all seen resources has increased over time and whether a current download requests previously seen resources
- The red GIF: Each resource (point) in the red GIF represents whether the hash value (calculated by Hash(URI-M + Status + Entity + Hdrs)) has been seen (color=red) or not (color=gray)
- The blue GIF: Each resource (point) in the blue GIF represents whether the URI-M of the resource is requested (color=blue) or not (color=gray)
- The green GIF: Each resource (point) in the green GIF represents whether the entity of the resource with "200-OK" has been seen (color=green) or not (color=gray)
